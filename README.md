## Goustito - the mini recipe bank

My aim with this app is to create a recipe search using the Edamam api. Ideally recipes will be searched either by recipe name, or by ingredient (the free api allows up to 5 ingredients in one search). I would like to display the following elements:

* Recipe name
* Ingredients
* Image
* Calories
* URL to recipe
* MAYBE diet tags (low fat, nut free etc)

## User profile

Once the initial app is up and running, I would like to create a basic user login system, most likely using MongoDB and implementing password hashing. Users would have the option of saving recipes to their profile, and creating a mini personalised virtual cookbook.

## Limitations

I predict that the free API will introduce a number of limitations, as there are often paywalls between users and the best api features (for example, max number of ingredients in a search). I will need to monitor the api functionality to ensure that I am not trying something that is prohibitted by the interface.

## Tech

I would like to include the following tech:

* React
* Typescript
* Jest/Enzyme
* Redux/Sagas
* SCSS/SASS
* Nodejs
* Bcrypt
* MongoDB/mongoose
